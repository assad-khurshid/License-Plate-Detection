## Project Overview

This project leverages the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) model, which is renowned for its speed and accuracy in object detection tasks. The model is trained on a custom dataset to specifically detect license plates. The application is built with a user-friendly interface using Flask, allowing users to upload images or stream video for real-time detection.

## Usage

1. Access the web interface via `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
2. Upload an image or start a video feed.
3. View the detected license plates in real-time.

## Methodology

The project follows a systematic approach to build a robust license plate detection system:

### Basic Detection Model

The model is trained using the YOLOv8 algorithm, which includes pretrained weights. The custom dataset used for training enhances the model's ability to accurately detect license plates under various conditions.

Hereâ€™s a diagram illustrating the YOLOv8 model's working principle:
